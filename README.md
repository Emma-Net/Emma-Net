# EmmaNet
A unified integrating framework for finding, building, and participating in non-exploitative, anti-capitalist alternatives to the goods, services, and organizations of capitalist society.

Disclaimer: "socialism" as used in this document will refer to "non-exploitative and anti-capitalist", it is not used in the sense of favoring one flavor of leftism over another (as long as these flavors do not contradict the basic principles of 'non-exploitative' and 'anti-capitalist'; we do not think this is an unreasonable requirement).


Goal:
    The goal is to provide a unified integrating framework for finding, building, and participating in non-exploitative, anti-capitalist alternatives to the goods, services, and organizations of capitalist society.
    It would not be a website, or a particular organization, it would be a community of people devoted to the cause of ending discrimination and exploitation everywhere, and replacing capitalism with socialism as the basis for our society, along with 

    a) a network facilitating the interaction between members of the community, 

    b) the tools necessary and useful for participating in this network and working towards these goals, and 

    c) the guiding principles which unite all of us towards these pursuits.



    List of socialist companies, minority-owned/operated companies, noprofits, charities, individuals in need, as alternatives to capitalist ones

    Beyond listing companies, the generalized issue is collectively operated supply-chain management of these systems.

    List of Politicians who represent our causes

    Perhaps we can require politicians who claim to be representative of us to derive all actions taken from consensus of the community, for example through legally binding contract maintained by the community.

    General platform for education about non-exploitative, anti-capitalist alternatives

    Also, transparency of interaction between participants

    Currently our knowledge, resources, and activities are spread thin across many different sites, repositories, and organizations. This is but one of the many facets of the information overload. Effectively managing this puts us all into a better position to be aware and make informed decisions. 

    In stoopkid's opinion, capitalist society is inherently incapable of competing with us along these ends: there is no solidarity or unity under capitalism; individuals and organizations who would wish to do the same as this will (and do) find themselves at a complete loss for how to make it happen. This is because each individual and organization working selfishly and alone towards these ends simply increases the magnitude of the information overload to begin with, and receives no support from the rest. Even Google struggles to manage it. Our unity is our greatest advantage; an advantage which will never, can never (almost by definition) be shared by capitalists.


Background:
    Capitalism doesn't work. Centralized power in the hands of just "a few investors" very soon leads to a company that makes profits at the expense of everyone else. This is institutionalized sociopathy, and should be given no more credit than that as an idea for how to organize a society.
    Socialism is on the rise, but people don't know that services might have alternatives without said corruption/exploitation that happens in capitalism, and likewise, those who have the means to provide such services might not know how/where to direct their efforts in order to create these alternatives viably.
    Identifying these companies that care about everyone makes it possible for consumers to make conscious choices about what they use.
    
    
Q: Who's project is this?
A: It is ours.
Q: If it's 'ours', then who is 'we'?
A: The participating individuals and organizations, as a collective whole.
Q: You mean you don't have a heirarchy of leadership???? How can that be??
A: ... why would we? :)

    04:31 <+yaraju> I don't trust any one man, or any committee to decide what's good for everyone. giving the power to any X, and assuming they will "do greater good" is plain folly, imho




Things to address:
    How do you get people to participate to make it work?

        In stoopkid's opinion, many of the benefits that will come along with such a thing are self-incentivizing.

    A: Crowd-source info, have a pre-vetted community of people from the minorities who approve the info?

        In stoopkid's opinion: transparency > verification, but this does not preclude people from doing verification of information. However, the verification process should be made fully transparent. 

        Always multiple people approving any piece of info?

    The more people who approve a piece of information, the better.

    Mutual trust between participating individuals?

    Mutual trust and common direction is the ultimate foundation on which this rests.

    Full transparency of interactions of participants can bolster this trust.

    Contributions by actions, rather than just voting/donating? i.e. 'do-ocracy'

    Motivate people to go through the platform to sign up for the "alernative services" by generating coupon codes or something? (Would give better metrics of reach of the platform)

    We might even have our own 'currency' :O

    Transparency of these metrics could drive more people switching to these alternatives (as well as keep out those who we probably don't want :)

    And would also make the system much more efficient in general. Transparency of things like "I have X" and "I need X" can allow for people to be linked together automatically. I'm not religious, but the aftermath in the story of the tower of Babel (i.e. everybody being split into different languages so that they could not communicate towards such ends) is very much like our current situation.Interesting point. Difference of culture/language shouldn't be barriers. Technology could potentially bridge such barriers as we have at least the common purpose of socialism.Absolutely. The way i sort of think of it is reversing the divide-and-conquer trick that's currently played on everybody.Yes. Instead of dividing, unite people.

    in first and establish the principles and structures that will ensure 

    it isn't just some lowest common denominator populist shit"

    "also TBH I would encourage if not require all co-ops to sooner or 

    later merge economically into an integrated entity rather than 

    disparate autonomous small businesses"

The technical stuff:

    Decentralized and distributed application frameworks.

    Q: Who has to pay for the servers to run this? 

    A: Nobody! 

    Q: How? Are you a wizard? 

    A: No! This is just one of the many benefits of decentralized/distributed applications. Rather than donate money, people can donate computational resources like storage and processing to the network by running software to allow them to participate as a node in the network. Other benefits include: 

    the removal of the necessity for centralized authority which would have a priveleged level of control, 

    the ability for the community to manage this as a collective whole,

    highly robust provision of services that comes from not having it provided exclusively through a single-point-of-failure (i.e. that centralized authority we've removed the need for)

16:43 <+stoopkid> hm. take nationbuilder and decentralize it and have it 
                  collectively operated by socialists and driven towards 
                  socialistic ends. that would be a good start
16:45 <+stoopkid> remove the need for this page:

Name:

    I think naming it after a non-male figure of social justice would be good. Some possibilities which have been suggested:

    Emma Goldman

    Assata Shakur

    Wilma Mankiller


    for expediency I've just been using "EmmaNet", but this is a decision for the community to make rather than myself.

    Hey again :)
    hello! Back? Yep :) Off to a good start i see
    Looks like it. :) But only got some pieces so far.... feel free to edit/add/fix, obviously. :P That's why we're here, rigth? :) Indeed :)
    Incidentally, when we say "minorities", we should probably think about the different anti's on the channel in finding these.

        E.g. how about options for people with disabilities for using the platform? Should think about this from the first launch? Absolutely we should

Also to consider: how do we make the development of the platform participatory? Feedback? Dev contributions? Probably on GitHub or something?
   This one is a hard question, with few solutions today that are fully satisfactory. But IMO block-chain technology can allow for this in a much more satisfactory manner. It allows for consensus to be formed and maintained in a fully decentralized environment, for example: consensus about the code-base of the network. It can also serve as a store of value, which has interesting implications (including the ability to redefine the *meaning* of value in ways that are more in-line with our views).
